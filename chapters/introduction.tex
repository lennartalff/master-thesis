\section{Motivation}

\section{Problem Statement}
Consider the scenario of the highly agile and underactuated HippoCampus \ac{uauv} maneuvering in a confined environment -- such as a water tank -- to reach a time dependent goal state.
Such a time dependent goal state can be represented by a moving ring, that is to be caught by the \ac{uauv}.
Additionally, there might be obstacles present, which make a method for collision avoidance mandatory.
Due to the physical limitations of wireless underwater communication \cite{Bettale08p1,GeistEtAl16}, all algorithms have to be executed on-board and in real time to allow for autonomous maneuvering.

From this scenario we can derive the following requirements for a trajectory generation and tracking system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item real time capability of the trajectory generation algorithm, when executed by the on-board hardware
    \item verification of the trajectories' feasibility based on the dynamics of the \ac{uauv}
    \item a control scheme to track the planned trajectory
    \item dynamic collision avoidance due to obstacles
\end{itemize}

Goal of this thesis is to develop such a system meeting the above-mentioned requirements and assess its performance by carrying out simulations and lab experiments.

\section{Contribution and Outline}

Based on a literature review in \Cref{sec:review-path-planning} on existing underwater path planning approaches in general and agile path planning -- including publications in the field of aerial vehicles -- the suitability of different approaches is discussed. 

By leveraging the synergies between aerobatic \acp{uav} and hydrobatic \acp{uauv}, the approach of computational efficient trajectory generation for quadrocopters in \cite{MuellerHehn15} is transferred to the underwater domain in \Cref{sec:approach-to-agile-maneuvering}.
This includes taking the differences in modelling the vehicle's dynamics into account and addressing them with respect to computational efficiency, robustness of the trajectory tracking performance, and the sampling strategy.

The dynamic model of the HippoCampus \ac{uauv} is derived in \Cref{sec:system-dynamics} and applied to the sampling-based trajectory generation framework presented in \Cref{sec:trajectory-generation} and \Cref{sec:feasibility}.
It is complemented by a attitude controller as proposed in \Cref{sec:control}.
The framework's implementation details are presented in this thesis are given in \Cref{sec:implementation}
