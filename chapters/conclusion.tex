\section{Summary}
\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item (experiment with actually moving target)
    \item Test obstacle avoidance in the first place!
    \item Extend obstacle avoidance to work with moving obstacles
    \item Can the approach be extended to allow for negative thrust? -- even more agile!! comparable to the parking problem
\end{itemize}
