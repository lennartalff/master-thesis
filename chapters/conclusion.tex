\section{Summary}
\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use thrust input from trajectory as feed forward in combination with velocity/acceleration controller.
    \item Extend obstacle avoidance to work with moving obstacles
    \item Can the approach be extended to allow for negative thrust?
\end{itemize}
